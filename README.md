## Historical-Alexa

### Motivation

This project was created for
[Week 3 of Code Prompts](http://www.reddit.com/r/codeprompts/comments/383ik7/week_3_create_an_app_that_stores_historical_alexa/).

The requirements were:
* Easy to use for an end-user.
* Store current traffic rankings that will become historical traffic ranks.
* Display historical traffic rankings in a graph.
* Use the Alexa API to get current traffic rankings.
* You may use any platform or programming language/method you desire.
